# ECON-120BH-VSP

This is my code and paper for my Honors Econometrics B course. I look at Course and Professor Evaluaions (CAPE) data to see if there is a linear relationship between a professor's experience (measured by number of courses taught) and the professor's student approval ratings in the economics department at UCSD. I run an OLS regression with course enrollment size and indicator variables for each course as control variables. See my paper [here](https://github.com/amandashu/ECON-120BH-VSP/blob/master/VSPAmanda5Mar2019.pdf).
